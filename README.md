PHP Arrays and Control Structures
=================================


In this course we'll be building on the foundational skills covered in the first PHP Basics course. We'll explore conditionals, loops and the compound variable, arrays, all of which help you write more powerful and intelligent programs using less code. We'll utilize these new skill by building several projects: Custom Messages for High School Students, a ping pong game and a todo app.
