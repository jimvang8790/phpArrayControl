PHP Arrays and Control Structures
=================================


In this course we'll be building on the foundational skills covered in the first PHP Basics course. We'll explore conditionals, loops and the compound variable, arrays, all of which help you write more powerful and intelligent programs using less code. We'll utilize these new skill by building several projects: Custom Messages for High School Students, a ping pong game and a todo app.

Logical Operators
-----------------

If we want to check for multiple conditions at once, we can combine conditional statements using logical operators.

Switch Case Statements
----------------------

PHP provides another control structure called a "switch" statement. Switch statements are similar to a series of IF statements that use the same expression. Switch statements allow you to compare many different values with the same variable or expression. For example: you may want to look at the day of the week, and perform different actions based on which day of the week it is.

Indexed Arrays
--------------

An array is a compound variable type meaning it can contain more than one value.

Arrays in PHP are actually ordered maps. A map is a type that associates values to keys. This type is optimized for several different uses; it can be treated as an array, list (vector), hash table (an implementation of a map), dictionary, collection, stack, queue, and probably more. As array values can be other arrays, trees and multidimensional arrays are also possible.
