PHP Arrays and Control Structures
=================================


In this course we'll be building on the foundational skills covered in the first PHP Basics course. We'll explore conditionals, loops and the compound variable, arrays, all of which help you write more powerful and intelligent programs using less code. We'll utilize these new skill by building several projects: Custom Messages for High School Students, a ping pong game and a todo app.

Logical Operators
-----------------

If we want to check for multiple conditions at once, we can combine conditional statements using logical operators.

Switch Case Statements
----------------------

PHP provides another control structure called a "switch" statement. Switch statements are similar to a series of IF statements that use the same expression. Switch statements allow you to compare many different values with the same variable or expression. For example: you may want to look at the day of the week, and perform different actions based on which day of the week it is.

Indexed Arrays
--------------

An array is a compound variable type meaning it can contain more than one value.

Arrays in PHP are actually ordered maps. A map is a type that associates values to keys. This type is optimized for several different uses; it can be treated as an array, list (vector), hash table (an implementation of a map), dictionary, collection, stack, queue, and probably more. As array values can be other arrays, trees and multidimensional arrays are also possible.

Associative Arrays
------------------

You can assign your own keys to array elements -- and they don't have to be numbers. In fact, your code can be easier to read and understand if you use a name for a key. This is called an Associative Array, because a specific key is associated with a specific value.

Arrays are also referred to as a hash or dictionary

Comma After Elements

The comma after the last array element is optional and can be omitted. This is usually done for single-line arrays, i.e. array(1, 2) is preferred over array(1, 2, ). For multi-line arrays on the other hand the trailing comma is commonly used, as it allows easier addition of new elements at the end.
